# Simple JS starter

This is a very simple way to start a JS project with linting and formatting:

- ESLint with [airbnb JS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for linting
- Prettier configuration for formatting
- Uses `eslint-config-prettier` to make ESLint ignore formatting rules handled by Prettier

## Instructions

1. Make sure node is installed (I recommend using [volta](https://volta.sh))
1. Make sure that Prettier and ESLint plugins are installed for your editor (I configure VSCode to format on save using Prettier)
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the directory
1. Run `npm install`
1. Start writing JavaScript!
